Algorithmics I

Assessed Exercise

Finding Huffman and LZW Compression Ratios
General

This is the only assessed practical exercise for Algorithmics 3. It carries 20% of the total assessment for the module.
As a rough guide, it is intended that an average Level 3 honours student should be able to obtain a good grade by putting
in about 15 hours work, and you are advised not to spend significantly more time than this on the exercise. It is recommended
that you start work on the exercise soon after it is given out - you will then be able to make best use of the dedicated lab
sessions - see below.

The exercise is to be done individually. Some discussion of the exercise among members of the class is to be expected, but
close working together, or copying of code, in any form, is strictly forbidden - refer to the Department's Plagiarism Policy
and Guidelines in the Level 3 Class Guide (available via moodle).

Deadline for submission

The hand-out date for the exercise is Thursday 22 October, by which time all the relevant material should have been covered
in lectures.  The deadline for submission is 10:00 am on Tuesday 17 November.  The marked exercise will be returned, together
with a detailed report, at the beginning of the second semester.  There will be lab sessions at 15:00 on Tuesday 3 and Tuesday
10 November, during which you will have the opportunity to ask questions on the exercise, and discuss your progress with the
course coordinator.


Specification

The purpose of the exercise is to write, in Java, two programs each of which will accept as input an arbitrary text file, and
will produce as output the compression ratio that would be achieved if that file were to be compressed using 
	(a) static Huffman coding, and 
	(b) a variant of the LZW compression algorithm.

Note that no actual compressed files are to be produced.  Your programs should do the minimum amount of work necessary to determine
the compression ratio in each case.

(a) In the case of static Huffman coding (based on a frequency count of the characters in the text file to be compressed), you
should ignore the fact that, in practice, some representation of the Huffman tree would have to be stored with the compressed file
(so that the compression ratio that you obtain will be a slight over-estimate of what could actually be achieved.)

(b) In the required variation of the LZW algorithm, compression should begin with codewords of length 8. Whenever the dictionary
becomes full the codeword length should be increased by 1, thereby doubling the size of the dictionary. There is no limit on the
size of the dictionary.

Clarifications
* Assume that each character occupies 1 byte in uncompressed files.

* The file to be compressed should be read from standard input, and the results should be written to standard output; the only
output produced by your programs should take the following form:

Original file length in bits = 12688
Compressed file length in bits = 5926
Compression ratio = 53.29%
Elapsed time: 2 milliseconds. 

* The final line of output reports the execution time of the program in seconds. The code to generate this output is included in
the skeleton programs provided. Note that it represents elapsed time, so may not be an accurate reflection of actual running time
depending on other processes that may be executing on the computer.

* For the LZW program, you should use a trie, appropriately customised, to represent the dictionary.  The trie class  provided for
the initial Lab Exercise can be used, with appropriate changes which will be necessary if you wish your program to be efficient.
This class will be delivered to you on set up.

Submission 

The set up files for the exercise are available under Moodle (these include skeleton program files, the Node and Trie classes used in the laboratory exercise, a template report file and three sample input
files). You may wish to create additional small input files for test purposes.

Submit an .zip archive of your work through Moodle. The archive should expand into a directory named after your 7-digit matriculation number. You can create such an archive through the command line by using the command:
zip -r 0123456.zip 0123456/

This directory should contain the following.
* A pdf file report.pdf generated from the report.tex file, containing:
- a status report, which should state whether you believe that your programs work correctly, and if not what happens when the program is compiled (in the case of compile-time errors) or run (in the case of run-time errors or incorrect output);
- a written discussion explaining how, in each case, your program obtains the information needed to calculate the compression ratio and justifying any implementation decisions;
- the output produced by your programs the test data provided.
* Folders Huffman and LZW containing all your .java files for the two programs.
* In each folder there should be a class Main.java containing your main method; apart from this there can be any number of other .java files and other folders corresponding to packages if you wish. But ensure that any redundant files are removed.

Please make sure you follow the submission instructions - the penalty for non-adherence to
Submission Instructions is 2 bands. Please therefore after you have created your zip file, to prevent a two band penalty, unzip this file in an empty directory and check that the created directory has the correct structure and naming. You can contact the course coordinator to help create a zip file with the correct
structure.

Marking scheme   

The exercise carries 20 marks, distributed as follows:
* Huffman implementation, correctness and efficiency:  	10 marks
* LZW implementation, correctness and efficiency:  		10 marks
* Report, quality of submitted code, overall presentation: 	8 marks
* Outputs from acceptance test:  				2 marks

This is primarily an Algorithmics exercise, rather than a Software Engineering exercise, but you may be penalised, under the third heading above, for poor software engineering practice.
